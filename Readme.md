# Binogi React Code Challenge

This code test involves the creation of a working React app using a 3rd party API. It’s designed to take 2-4 hours.

## The Challenge

Create a React web application for searching through the recipes using the public API, and implement a solution for bookmarking the recipes client-side.

The recipes API is called [Edamam Recipe Search API](https://dejnrveloper.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api). For the API, you can use our account with Application ID: `df53c267` and Application Key: `bd80595496a524a833554462aa41a04c` (you can also create your own account).

The web application should include the following functionality:

- **Search view**
  - Display a search form with a search field.
  - Optional:
    - Include advanced search filtering input fields for `diet`, `health`, `cuisineType`, `mealType`, `dishType` and `calories` range.
    - Display search results list that consists of recipe `picture`, `label`, `calories`, `healthLabels` and `dietLabels`
    - UI to load more results
- **Recipe Info view/dialog/modal** when a user clicks on recipe search result
  - UI to bookmark the recipe
  - Optional:
    - Display more information about the recipe like `ingredients`, `nutrients` and `digest` details.
- **Bookmarked Recipes view**
  - List of all bookmarked recipes.
    - Optional:
      - UI to remove recipes from the list.

## Requirements and Restrictions

- The app must be built using React.
- Feel free to use any libraries/plugins that you need (e.g. for state management or styling).
- Try to make the UI look “nice enough”.
- Focus on code quality and structure.
- Use TypeScript

### Optional:

- Implement a solution to store and manage the app’s state
- Persist the bookmarks state
- Use a component library
- Write some unit-tests
- Make it look good on mobile as well as desktop
- Deploy the app to a hosting service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
